# Evaluation of Hemolysis Data and its Epidemiological Interdependencies: A Bioinformatics Approach

## Overview

This repository contains the data, code, and analysis associated with my Master's thesis titled *"Evaluation of Hemolysis Data and its Epidemiological Interdependencies: A Bioinformatics Approach"*. The project uses bioinformatics techniques to analyze hemolysis index data across various clinics and assess the epidemiological factors influencing hemolysis levels.

## Project Description

Hemolysis, the breakdown of red blood cells, can significantly impact clinical laboratory results and patient care. This study aims to:

1. **Analyze Hemolysis Data:** Evaluate the distribution of hemolysis index (`wert`) across different clinical settings, including Emergency Rooms (ERs) and Non-ER clinics.
2. **Identify Epidemiological Interdependencies:** Explore the relationship between hemolysis and various factors such as seasonality, time of day, gender, and type of medical service.
3. **Develop Predictive Models:** Use Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to understand the influence of these factors on hemolysis index levels.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Install R and Required Packages**: Ensure you have R installed along with the necessary packages, which include `readxl`, `writexl`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, and `ggplot2`.
2. **Load Data and Scripts**: Clone this repository and navigate to the `Scripts` directory. Load the data and run the scripts in the appropriate order.
3. **Generate Outputs**: The scripts will output descriptive statistics, visualizations, and model results in the `Results` directory.
